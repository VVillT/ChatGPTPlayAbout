For multitasking and moderate usage: If you often have multiple applications running simultaneously or engage in moderate multitasking with tasks like video editing or graphic design, consider opting for 16GB of RAM. This will provide you with a smoother experience and better multitasking capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For resource-intensive tasks: If you're involved in tasks that demand a significant amount of memory, such as 3D modeling, video rendering, or running virtual machines, consider getting 32GB or more of RAM. This will ensure smooth performance and prevent any slowdowns or bottlenecks.\n",
      "\n",
